    "question": "What are the primary differences between climate change and global warming, and how do they impact ecosystems differently?",
    "answer": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels. Global warming is a specific aspect of climate change and refers to the Earth's rising surface temperature. While global warming leads to more intense heat waves, climate change encompasses a broader range of effects such as rising sea levels, shifts in animal migration patterns, and changes in plant blooming times. These changes disrupt ecosystems by altering habitats, reducing biodiversity, and affecting food chains."

    "question": "Explain how the Pythagorean Theorem works and give a real-world example of how it might be applied in construction or design.",
    "answer": "The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry, stating that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Mathematically, it's expressed as a² + b² = c². In construction, this theorem helps in determining the correct length of materials to ensure 90-degree angles when framing walls or laying out foundations. For example, if a contractor is building a rectangular base with one side 6 feet and the other 8 feet, the diagonal should be 10 feet to confirm the right angle."

    "question": "What is the difference between front-end and back-end development in web technologies, and why is understanding both important for full-stack developers?",
    "answer": "Front-end development focuses on the visual aspects of a website or application that users interact with directly, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development involves the server-side logic, databases, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that process and store data, using languages such as Python, PHP, or Node.js. For full-stack developers, understanding both is crucial because it allows them to build fully functioning applications from the ground up, troubleshoot problems across the stack, and bridge communication between UI and server-side logic effectively."

    "question": "How does the process of photosynthesis work in plants, and what role does it play in the global carbon cycle?",
    "answer": "Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. It occurs in the chloroplasts using chlorophyll. The equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. This process not only provides energy for the plant itself but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere and removes carbon dioxide from it. It plays a vital role in the carbon cycle by acting as a natural carbon sink, helping to balance CO₂ levels in the atmosphere and mitigating the effects of climate change."

    "question": "What were the main causes and consequences of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union?",
    "answer": "The Cold War was primarily caused by ideological differences between the capitalist United States and the communist Soviet Union after World War II. Tensions arose due to mutual distrust, competition for global influence, and nuclear arms development. Key events included the Berlin Blockade, Korean War, Cuban Missile Crisis, and Vietnam War. The Cold War lasted from 1947 to 1991, ending with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Its consequences included the formation of NATO, arms races, technological advancements such as the space race, and significant impacts on foreign policy and global political alignments for decades."
